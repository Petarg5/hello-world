# Hello World :earth_africa:
This repository serves as an update to my first GitHub repo from 2016. It contains 40 different file types, each demonstrating how to print the text "Hello World" in various programming languages.

All code examples are designed to work in online sandboxes or playgrounds, allowing you to run them without the need for complex setup for each language.

Feel free to explore the repository and see how different languages achieve the same output! :rocket::sparkles:
